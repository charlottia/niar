# Niar

<https://sr.ht/~kivikakk/niar>

A small framework for building projects with [Amaranth]. Provides support for
using [CXXRTL], optionally with [Zig] and [zxxrtl].

See the [template project] for usage, [Sae] for what I'm working on right now,
and [ili9341spi] for a complete example with Zig.

See the [CHANGELOG] for updates and what's yet to be released.
